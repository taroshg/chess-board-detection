# Chess Board Detection
The goal of this project is to have users take a picture of any tournament chessboard position and convert it into a digital position ready to be analyized by an engine. This can also be extened to recording realtime games without the use of expensive hardware to track the position.

### TODO:
    - create piece detection model
    - solve piece localization

### Labeling Process:
    - Board Labelers need to ensure that order of points should be (a8, h8, h1, a1)
